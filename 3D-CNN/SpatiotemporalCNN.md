#### Spontaneous Facial Micro-Expression Recognition using 3D Spatiotemporal Convolutional Neural Networks  
##### Abstract  
Fake facial ex- pressions are difficult to be recognized even by humans.  
Facial micro-expressions generally represent the actual emotion of a person, as it is a spontaneous reaction expressed through human face.  
Despite of a few attempts made for recognizing micro-expressions, still the problem is far from being a solved problem, which is depicted by the poor rate of ac- curacy shown by the state-of-the-art methods.  
A few CNN based approaches are found in the literature to recognize micro-facial expressions from still images.   
This paper proposes two 3D-CNN methods: MicroExpSTCNN and MicroExpFuseNet, for spontaneous facial micro-expression recognition by exploiting the spatiotemporal information in CNN framework. The MicroExpSTCNN considers the full spatial information, whereas the MicroExpFuseNet is based on the 3D-CNN feature fusion of the eyes and mouth regions.   
The experiments are performed over CAS(ME)^2 and SMIC micro- expression databases.
